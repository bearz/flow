# Pradix — Product Radix
Pradix stands for "Product Radix" — a set of basics that every modern SaaS application has to solve one way or another. Clojure and ClojureScript are excellent tools for solving programming challenges. Pradix aims one level higher — enable developers to focus on user challenges by providing solutions for typical programming challenges like data models, UI, web-handlers, validation, exceptions and other. The goal of pradix is to separate product intent and "jobs to be done" by users from implementation details to allow non-developer teams (stakeholders, designers, products, care) to reason about a product in the same language with developers.  We hope that this structure is going to help teams to keep users' needs as the main priority and deliver overall better products. 

We know that we can't solve for every use case out there, so we build extensibility and composability as first-class citizens of pradix. It must be easy to replace or enhance a default approach if a need arises. And doing so enables developers to reuse a vast amount of fantastic frameworks and libraries written already.
